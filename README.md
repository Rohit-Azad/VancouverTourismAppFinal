# VancouverTourismAppFinal

Vancouver Tourism app is an app which I designed as part of a group during Mobile Application Development - 2 course.
This project implements multiple features such as:
- Tab Layout
- RecyclerView
- RecyclerView Touch Listener
- Master/Detail Fragment
- AWS as backend Server
- Table View
- firebase integration
- Json parsing
- Client/Server  interaction
- much more

I added a demo that explains everything we can do with this application.
